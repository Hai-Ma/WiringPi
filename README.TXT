Note
====
This is an unofficial mirror of WiringPi. I have made my own changes to the repository,
including updates for RaspberryPi 4. I'm not sure if the changes are complete, and I
don't guarantee that everything works. I just needed to have some things working for my Pi4.

Please do not email Gordon if you have issues, he will not be able to help.
Pull-requests are not currently accepted, since this is a mirror.
For support, comments, questions, etc please join the WiringPi Discord channel: https://discord.gg/SM4WUVG

wiringPi README
===============

Please note that the official way to get wiringPi is via git from
git.drogon.net and not GitHub.

ie.

  git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi

The version of wiringPi held on GitHub by "Gadgetoid" is used to build the
wiringPython, Ruby, Perl, etc. wrappers for these other languages. This
version may lag the official Drogon release.  Pull requests may not be
accepted to Github....

Please see

  http://wiringpi.com/

for the official documentation, etc. and the best way to submit bug reports, etc.
is by sending an email to projects@drogon.net

Thanks!
