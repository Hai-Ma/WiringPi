WiringPi (Rhizomatica's Fork)
=================================

This is an unofficial fork of wiringPi which supports newer Linux distributions
and kernel versions.  With the end of official development, this repository has
become our fork of a working WiringPi version for all versions of Debian Linux,
and all Raspberries Pi up to and including version 4 (for Raspberry Pi 1 or
early 2 revisions, edit wiringPi/wiringPi.c and change gpioLayout to 1).
Raspberry Pi 5 will not be supported. Use gpiolib instead for new projects.
